##               Recipe Discovery App
<div style="text-align: center;"> 
Overview
For this project, you will build a client-side “Recipe Discovery” application. This project will serve as a comprehensive demonstration of your mastery of advanced React concepts. The application will allow users to browse recipes by category, search for specific recipes, view detailed recipe information, and manage a personal list of “favorite” recipes.

You will use a free, public API for recipe data and implement a varietys of hooks, state management patterns, and routing solutions to create a feature-rich, single-page application (SPA).

Time Allocation
In-class time: 3.5 hours
Outside of class: At instructor’s discretion
Core Requirements
You will build a Recipe Discovery application using the TheMealDB API (a free API, no key required).

***1. State Management & Data Fetching***

Use the useState and useEffect hooks to fetch and display data from the API.
Your application should manage loading and error states gracefully, displaying appropriate UI indicators to the user (e.g., a loading spinner, an error message).

*2. Custom Hooks*

You must create and implement at least two custom hooks:
useFetch (or similar): A generic custom hook for handling data fetching logic. It should manage the data, loading state, and error state. This hook will be used throughout your application to communicate with the API.
useLocalStorage: A custom hook to synchronize a piece of state with the browser’s localStorage. This will be used to persist the user’s list of favorite recipes.

*3. Global State with Context API*

Create a FavoritesContext to manage the user’s list of favorite recipes globally.
The context must provide:
A list of favorite recipe IDs.
A function to add a recipe to favorites.
A function to remove a recipe from favorites.
A function to check if a recipe is already in favorites.
This context should use your useLocalStorage hook internally to persist the favorites list across browser sessions.

*4. Routing*

Your application must include the following pages and routing logic:
Home Page (/):
Displays a grid or list of all available recipe categories fetched from the API.
Each category should be a link that navigates to its respective category page.
Category Page (/category/[categoryName]):
A dynamic route that displays all recipes belonging to the category specified in the URL (e.g., /category/Seafood).
Each recipe shown should be a link to its detailed recipe page.
Recipe Detail Page (/recipe/[recipeId]):
A dynamic route that fetches and displays the full details for a single recipe (image, ingredients, instructions, etc.).
This page must include a button to “Add to Favorites” or “Remove from Favorites”. The button’s state and action should be handled by your FavoritesContext.
Favorites Page (/favorites):
Displays a list of all recipes that the user has marked as a favorite.
If the user has no favorites, this page should display a message prompting them to browse and add some.
Search Functionality:
A search bar, likely in a shared Navbar, that allows users to search for recipes by name.
Submitting a search should navigate the user to a search results page (e.g., /search?query=Arrabiata). This page will display the results of the search query.

*5. Components & UI*

Create reusable, well-styled components (e.g., RecipeCard, Navbar, Spinner, ErrorMessage).
The application should be visually appealing and responsive. Use of a CSS framework, CSS-in-JS, or CSS Modules is up to you.
TheMealDB API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available for use, but are only examples. You will need to explore the API documentation  and use the endpoints that best fit the needs of your application.

List all categories: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php
Filter by category: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Seafood
Lookup full recipe details by ID: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=52772
Search meal by name: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=Arrabiata

# Submission Guidelines
GitHub Repository: A link to a public GitHub repository containing the complete source code for your project.
README.md: The repository must include a README.md file that contains:
A brief description of the application and its features.
Instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project locally.

Reflection: A short section in your README.md or in a separate REFLECTION.md file detailing:
The most challenging part of the project for you.
A brief explanation of a design decision you made (e.g., why you structured a hook a certain way, how you decided to manage a piece of state).

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...

      // Remove tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
      tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
      // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
      tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
      // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
      tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,

      // Other configs...
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...
      // Enable lint rules for React
      reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'],
      // Enable lint rules for React DOM
      reactDom.configs.recommended,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])
```
